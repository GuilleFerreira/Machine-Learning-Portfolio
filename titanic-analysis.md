## Context
The RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that embarked on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City, USA, in April 1912. Regarded as one of the most luxurious and technologically advanced ships of its time, the Titanic was considered "unsinkable." However, tragedy struck when the ship struck an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912.

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. The ship carried over 2,200 passengers and crew, but due to a shortage of lifeboats and other factors, more than 1,500 people lost their lives in the disaster. The sinking prompted significant changes in maritime safety regulations and practices.
